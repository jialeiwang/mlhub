# mlhub
This repository contains Machine Learning (ML) components code, as part of the MLPiper project.

## Components
An ML Component is a code block that can run on its own or be connected to other ML Components to create a pipeline.

## Note
This is a very early release. Definition of components and pipelines will appear here shortly.

The MLPiper project will include 3 other parts:

1) mlcomp - a runner which will run components and pipelines.
2) mlops - an API to instrument components for reporting statistics.
3) mlhealth - examples of how health of machine learning pipelines can be computed
